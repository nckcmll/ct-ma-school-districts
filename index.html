          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p><a href='https://schoolstatefinance.org/'>The School + State Finance Project</a> is a non-profit organization whose stated aim is to work with Connecticut policymakers to eliminate disparities in funding education funding across the state. This work includes addressing and researching how funding varies across districts based on certain student enrollment demographics, such as being low-income, a multilingual learner, or having a disability. But the project’s main focus, as well as that of this data story, is school funding gaps along racial/ethnic lines; as the project has found, decades of exclusionary policies and laws have left Connecticut segregated, with the state’s towns that have the highest percentages of Black, Indigenous, Latino, and any other person of color (BILPOC) residents frequently having some of the lowest median household incomes in the state <a href='https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/segregated-connecticut'>(source)</a>. </p>

          <p>Our work here continues from this question of how state spending varies across Connecticut school districts, particularly by using spending per enrolled student as a metric. While much of the groundwork regarding this question has been laid by the School + State Finance Project, we hope to offer a more regional analysis by studying similar data in the neighboring state of Massachusetts. Our hope is that, by expanding our scope of analysis to southern New England in this way, we can find patterns between these two states that might pave the way for researching new potential remedies, while simultaneously raising awareness of financial inequality that impacts a broader swath of American youths.</p>

          <h2>Massachusetts Data</h2>

          <iframe title="Median Household Income in MA Towns and Percent BILPOC District Enrollment" aria-label="Choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-SVv1M" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SVv1M/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="560" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

          <p>Figures 1 and 2: A map of median household income in Massachusetts, compared with a table of MA school district BILPOC enrollment percentages.</p>

          <p>The map above reveals that some of the towns in Massachusetts with the highest median household income are in the eastern half of the state, mainly surrounding Boston. The table of MA school districts, on the other hand, reveals that these wealthy suburbs routinely have lower percentages of BILPOC students enrolled in their local districts. Take Tewksbury; the map reveals it to have a median household income of $234.6K, while the table shows that its town school district has a BILPOC enrollment of only 22.2%. Similarly, Wilmington, which has one of the highest median incomes at $250k, has a BILPOC enrollment of 19.7%.</p>

          <p>Some of MA’s school districts are regional, and thus could not be placed precisely on the state map. Others are charter school districts, routinely have very high percentages of BILPOC students. An interesting example can be seen with the Foxborough Regional Charter district, which has a rather high BILPOC enrollment of 85.3%. But the town’s school district has only 27.3% BILPOC enrollment, and its median household income is also one of the highest visible on the map at $250k. This observation calls into question whether or not these regional/charter districts, which seem predominantly BILPOC, have similar levels of school funding as predominantly white ones, even when they’re within the same region.</p>

          <h2>How We Got Our Data</h2>

          <p> Our data for Massachusetts came from ACS Social Explorer as well as the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Our two-in-one visualization consisting of a map and chart allows the viewer to go back and forth between locating a town’s median household income and searching for its BILPOC enrollment. These could not easily be overlaid onto one visualization because some of MA’s school districts don’t have clear geographic boundaries, being regional instead of within a town’s boundaries. </p>

          <p>We found data for CT by going to EdSight ("Per Pupil Expenditures by Funding Source"). After going to EDSight, we were able to find the data we needed and download it directly. We then put them into Google Sheets and cleaned up the data as necessary. The CT data was then cleaned up and calculations were made to obtain the specific kind of data we’re looking for: the amount of BILPOC students in each district, which we then used to calculate the percentage of BIPOC students enrolled. The main thing that we knew would be a struggle and are still working on is to make sure that we are giving accurate data by normalizing the data across states and ensuring that definitions of BILPOC for both states are the same. </p>

          <h2>EDIT Section 4 Label: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can prepare a JPG or PNG file (preferably with all lower-case text and no spaces in the filename) and upload it directly into your GitHub repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image1.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Next, write an HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">

          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>

              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
